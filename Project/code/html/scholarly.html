        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <h3 id="purpose">1.1 Purpose &amp; Product Scope</h3>
        <p>The software product that is hereby submitted to your viewing is titled <i>Web Garden 1.0</i> and it allows the users to interact with a vast array of functionalities. The main goal of our website is to allow customers buy flowers for themselves and sell other flowers that they cultivate. To this end, the users may create an account on our platform and manage a list of favorite flowers that they intend to buy. The flowers will be determined to be ready for purchase after their pictures will be run through an incredibly complex color analysis algorithm (a third party software), and, depending on the chromatic density of the image, an email and browser notification will be sent to the client. The platform also allows users to put up flowers for sale through an easy-to-use interface.</p>
        <h3 id="intended-audience">1.2 Intended audience</h3>
        <p>This product is intended for people that are passionate with the subject of horticulture, but also for people that want to buy some flowers for themselves or give them to someone else, as a gift. The possibilities are endless.</p>

        <h2>2. Overall description</h2>
        <h3 id="product-perspective">2.1 Product perspective</h3>
        <p>Web Garden is a standalone, novel, self-contained product that is available to users online. The major components of the overall system is shown below:</p>
        
        <h3 id="product-functions">2.2 Product functions</h3>
        <p>The product allows users to perform the following actions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>login/logout</li>
            <li>sign up</li>
            <li>change password</li>
            <li>follow the development of flowers</li>
            <li>buy flowers</li>
            <li>sell flowers</li>
            <li>plant flowers</li>
            <li>receive notifications on the current weather and the state of the flowers</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 id="operating-environment">2.3 Operating environment</h3>
        <p>This is a web application that can be interacted with through any of the widely and freely available browsers that exist (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, etc.). As a result, the product runs independent of the operating system, and so it can be accessed by Windows, Linux, MacOS and even TempleOS users. There are no known conflicts with any other application on a user's computer.</p>
        
        <h3 id="design-and-implementation-constraints">2.4 Design and implementation constraints</h3>
        <p>This application has been written entirely in HTML, CSS and Javascript. On the server side, it uses Node.JS for handling client requests and Mongo DB for managing the database. It does not utilise any frameworks or any other tools that would've made working on it much easier.</p>
        
        <h3 id="user-documentation">2.5 User documentation</h3>
        <p>The current document is considered user documentation and it is readily available on the website, on the main page and on the landing page, by clicking the 'Help' button at the bottom. </p>
        
        <h3 id="assumptions-and-dependencies">2.6 Assumptions and dependencies</h3>
        <p>This application is dependent on the current Web Technologies standards. It also depends on the Node.JS and Mongo DB technologies. Any failure on the part of these technologies will ultimately lead to the downfall of the web application, rendering it useless. The developers of this web app do not take responsibility for the maintenance of third-party technologies, nor do they offer warranty towards the suitability of this application for any purpose, not even on as-is basis.</p>

            Database
        </h4>
        <div class="interface-item db-item">
            <p>The app makes use of a noSQL database, Mongo DB, to keep track of its data, including transactions, sales offers posted by users, the details of each product put up for sale and the general details surounding the species of flowers. It also contains a collection 'category' for a better optimisation and classification of the products on display. We have chosen Mongo DB for an easier integration on the backend part, due its ease of use and reliability. We are running the database in a Docker container.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>
            Server
        </h4>
        <div class="interface-item">
            <p>We decided to go with Node.js due to its ability to make use of JavaScript on the backend side as well, therefore cutting down on development time, by using the same conventions. It also makes the code easier to maintain. On top of that, Node.js makes it very easy to connect a server to a Mongo DB database through it's variety of drivers, capable of handling a large number of requests. It also has a variety of open source libraries that help with standard functionalities, such as Nodemailer when it comes to sending emails of any kind.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Change password</h3>
        <p>For security reasons, the database does not store the passwords of the users. Instead, the user who forgot their password and can no longer access their account must enter their email address in the input field and await an email that will provide them with a link to introduce a new password.</p>
        
        <h3>4.4 Follow the development of flowers</h3>
        <p>In order to do this, the user who is looking to sell flowers must go to the 'My Garden' page on the website and check the section labelled 'Flori in curs de crestere'. By pressing the 'Verifica' button, a pop up window will show, displaying information about the selected flower, such as its name, current growth status and environmental conditions.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, the user looking to buy flowers must go to the 'My Account' page, check the section labelled 'Florile pe care le urmaresti', then press the 'Verifica' button and have the behaviour described above play out. Furthermore, users will be notified by email and by a browser notification when the status of one of the flowers changes.</p>
        
        <h3>4.5 Buy flowers</h3>
        <p>In order to buy a flower, the logged in user must first select the flower that they wish to buy, then click the 'Add to cart ' button on the product page, or the shopping cart item next to the flower. They will then be redirected to their shopping, where they will be able to see all the products they have added to their basket. There, they will be able to complete their order and will be redirected to the payment page.</p>

        <h3>4.6 Sell flowers</h3>
        <p>In order to sell a flower, the logged in user must go to the specific form page and input the required information about the product he's about to auction. These range from basic properties like name, price and description to more specific information, such as optimal conditions for growing or indexing data, such as season and category of plants. Upon clicling submit, the user will be redirected to the product page of the plant, displayed for sale. </p>

        <h3>4.7 Receive notifications about your flowers</h3>
        <p>When the environment conditions become unsuitable for your flowers, you will receive an email and browser notification about this. This decision is made by comparing the optimal conditions for the flowers with the data provided to the application by a third-party weather software. If it is determined that they fall out of a specific sensibility range,you will be notified about it so that you can take the proper measures and shield your flowers from hazard.</p>
